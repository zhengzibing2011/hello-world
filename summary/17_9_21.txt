From now on, I will write some summary about the gains that I have get on that day!
1. Understanding the transformation from full connect layer to convolution net, mainly about the computing of parameters.
2. Learning how to write deploy.prototxt file depends on train_val.prototxt. Just removing the params about weight, bias and modifing data layer.
3. Learning how to delete file on local repository and synchronize with github.
That's all!
